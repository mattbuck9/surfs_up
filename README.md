## Deliverable One - Tempuratures in June
### Despite what I believe was the correct coding, my results were ever so slightly different, with a few more data points. My data showed that the minimum tempurature in June was 63 degrees, the maximum tempurature was 87 degrees, and the mean was 73.68 degrees. Standard diviation was 3.355783... degrees.

## Deliverable Two - Tempuratures in December
### In this case, my data matched that of the source file. It showed that the minimum tempurature in December was 56 degrees, the maximum tempurature was 83 degrees, and the mean tempurature was 71.04 degrees. Standard deviation was 3.745920... degrees.

## How do they compare?
### The tempurature in June and December is rather similar. The minimum in December is only 7 degrees colder, and the maximum in June was only 4 degrees warmer. The difference between the two means is also only 2.5 degrees. Standard deviation is similar in both months, with it being a little higher in December.
